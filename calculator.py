# I liked this set of instructions since I eventually will create a calculator with a full functionality
# I will use the calculator since Iâ€™m trying to create an app for a consulting person who will be couching
# other and I think that this will add a bit to my Python knowledge.
# I will try to add the if statement incase I enter other symbol than the 4 we use here.
