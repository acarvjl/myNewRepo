# This python program demonstrates the Python programming concepts in Cengage module (chapter) three.
#
# The "largest of three" program in Python is coded here using one nested if statement, a compound if statement, and
# another solution from ChatGPT

#    int, string, double, and bool variable types were used
#    The primitive data type "str" was demonstrated by getting and displaying user name, outputting the quotient of
#    the first input number by the second input number

#    variable data type was demonstrated with the type() function.
